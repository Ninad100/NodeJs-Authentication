## AWS Hosted Link

I have deployed this project in an AWS Linux machine. The hosted Link is given below. So that you know, I will terminate this server after some time when I will start the new project.
The reason behind doing this is I am using the Free tier version of AWS hence, to stay within the limit I will remove the deployment of the previous project. But all the screenshots from the Deployment are added below.

## Explanation

This is NodeJs based authentication system. In this system, the user can get authenticated either via registering to the application itself or by using OAUTH Google authentication system.
Once the user has performed the login we have given the feature to Reset the password as well. There is one more feature called Forget Password. For this feature the user will get OTP on his email id.
OTP-based verification will then lead to the reset of forgotten passwords.
